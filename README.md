[Captioned Scene](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/WFRvXCw1e0IN0MZVcusaixNdExeF5XV70PPqxDSsDCA)
>In this project I created a scene where a guy in a wheelchair is crossing the street and a guy is yelling at him to move out of the way

[Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/SFPeyv1jAZZf3sFVp1tP5yUk9yQKYvRu0MwDOulv674)
>In this card you're given a definitive amount of time to tap children to change them into costumes and once that time counts all the way down to zero you get jumpscared. The jumpscare still happens even if you tap all the children.

[Side Scroller](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/R8cCDk9F7lpfLJ_yyPjq_EIJwM3r9F_8xRTQ49LOTME)
>In this project you'll be playing as a guy in a wheelchair who crosses the street to collect a coin. Once the coin is collected the guy in the wheelchair respawns at the top of the screen from which he started and has to do it again collect enough coins to make a highscore.
